## Intro to Battleship: Battleship is a classic two-player guessing game where each player has a grid representing a sea area. Each player arranges their ships on their grid without the opponent seeing. Players take turns calling out coordinates to try to hit their opponent's ships. If a player's guess matches a location of their opponent's ship, it's a hit; otherwise, it's a miss. The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. 

Today, you will be playing against the computer.Our code has determined the position of the 5 ships found in the board. Your job is to try and find where the computer's ships are. The board consists of 10 columns (named A-J) and 10 rows (numbered 1-10), you must enter the column letter and then the row number to insert your guess.
